    "* You can choose to do a presentation for 10% of your grade (see syllabus for details),\n",

    "* You will present to the whole group in one of our normal class times, \n",
    "* You may present however you think best illustrates the key ideas (you may use the whiteboards, slides, jupyter notebook, ....),\n",
    "* Note that 10 minutes is not very long! Pick something interesting but be wary of the time constraints,\n",
